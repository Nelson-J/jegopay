#This text explains how best to contribute to development:

The project has two branches:
*development branch : For development activities
*production branch : For deploying the application

If you are working on a new feature you would like to implement,
1. Create a local development branch
2. Clone or pull from the remote development branch
3. Implement the feature
4. Commit then push to remote development branch
